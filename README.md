# EX 01 - Python OOP: Abstract Class & Method Example

##  AIM

To create an **abstract class** named `Shape` with an **abstract method** `calculate_area`, and implement this method in two subclasses: `Rectangle` and `Circle`.

---

##  ALGORITHM

1. **Import ABC module**:
   - Use `from abc import ABC, abstractmethod` to define abstract classes and methods.

2. **Create Abstract Class `Shape`**:
   - Define an abstract method `calculate_area()` with `@abstractmethod`.

3. **Create Subclass `Rectangle`**:
   - Set default values for `length` and `breadth`.
   - Override `calculate_area()` to compute the rectangle area.

4. **Create Subclass `Circle`**:
   - Set default value for `radius`.
   - Override `calculate_area()` to compute the circle area.

5. **Create Objects & Call Methods**:
   - Instantiate `Rectangle` and `Circle`.
   - Call their `calculate_area()` methods.

---

##  Program
```
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
import math

class Shape(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def calculate_area(self):
        pass

class Rectangle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, length=1, breadth=1):
        self.length = length
        self.breadth = breadth

    def calculate_area(self):
        return self.length * self.breadth

class Circle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, radius=1):
        self.radius = radius

    def calculate_area(self):
        return math.pi * self.radius ** 2

rect = Rectangle(5, 3)
circle = Circle(4)

print("Area of Rectangle:", rect.calculate_area())
print("Area of Circle:", circle.calculate_area())

```

# EXP 02- Python OOP: Encapsulation with Private Members

## AIM

To implement **Encapsulation** in Python by defining a class `Rectangle` with **private member variables** `__length` and `__breadth`.

---

##  ALGORITHM

1. **Define the Class**:
   - Create a class `Rectangle` with two private attributes: `__length` and `__breadth`.

2. **Initialize Variables**:
   - Use the `__init__()` constructor to set initial values for `__length` and `__breadth`.

3. **Print Values**:
   - Display the private variables from within the class to demonstrate access.

4. **Instantiate the Object**:
   - Create an object of the `Rectangle` class to trigger the constructor.

---

## Program
```
class Rectangle:
    def __init__(self, length, breadth):
        self.__length = length
        self.__breadth = breadth
        print("Length:", self.__length)
        print("Breadth:", self.__breadth)

rect = Rectangle(10, 5)

```

# EX 03 -  Method Overriding-Fish and Shark Class Inheritance in Python

##  AIM:
To write a Python program that demonstrates class inheritance by creating a parent class `Fish` with a method `type`, and a child class `Shark` that overrides the `type` method.

##  ALGORITHM:

1. Define the `Fish` class with a method named `type()` that prints `"fish"`.
2. Define the `Shark` class as a subclass of `Fish`, and override the `type()` method to print `"shark"`.
3. Create an instance of the `Fish` class named `obj_goldfish`.
4. Create an instance of the `Shark` class named `obj_hammerhead`.
5. Use a `for` loop to iterate over both objects.
6. Within the loop, call the `type()` method using the loop variable.
7. Output will demonstrate method overriding: printing `"fish"` and `"shark"` accordingly.

##  PROGRAM:
```
class Fish:
    def type(self):
        print("fish")

class Shark(Fish):
    def type(self):
        print("shark")

obj_goldfish = Fish()
obj_hammerhead = Shark()

for fish in (obj_goldfish, obj_hammerhead):
    fish.type()

```
